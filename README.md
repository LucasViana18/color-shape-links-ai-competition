# Board Game AI

An assignment for the Artificial Intelligence course unit

*Under construction*

## Introduction

*Under construction*

## Goals

The main goal of this project is to implement a competitive AI for the
board game included in this repository, the rules of which are similar to the
[Simplexity] board game. However, this board game can played with arbitrary
number of rows and columns, as well as accepting different number of pieces for
achieving victory.

## How to

Students should implement a minimum of two classes. If your AI is called
*VerySmart*, the classes are as follows:

* `VerySmartAI`, which extends [`AIPlayer`].
* `VerySmartAIThinker`, which implements [`IThinker`].

These classes should be in their own folder, which in turn should be placed at
[`Assets/Scripts/AI/AIs/`]. This folder contains some examples of dumb AIs to
demonstrate how this works.
