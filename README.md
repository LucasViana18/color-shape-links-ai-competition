# Board Game AI

An assignment for the Artificial Intelligence course unit

*Under construction*

## Introduction

*Under construction*

## Goals

The main goal of this project is to implement a competitive AI for the
board game included in this repository, the rules of which are similar to the
[Simplexity] board game. However, this board game can played with arbitrary
number of rows and columns, as well as accepting different number of pieces in
a row for achieving victory.

## How to

Students should implement a minimum of two classes. For example, if your AI is
called *G03VerySmart*, these classes are as follows:

1. **`G03VerySmartAI`**, which extends [`AIPlayer`]. This class should be added
   as a component of the `SessionConfiguration` game object, and allows your AI
   to be found by the game.
2. **`G03VerySmartAIThinker`**, which implements the [`IThinker`] interface.
   This is were you should actually implement the AI.

These classes should be in their own folder, `G03VerySmart`, which in turn
should be placed at [`Assets/Scripts/AI/AIs/`]. This folder contains some
examples of dumb AIs to demonstrate how your project should be organized.

### The class that extends `AIPlayer`

This class allows your AI to be found by the game. For that purpose, it must
be added as a component of the `SessionConfiguration` game object, and
implement the following read-only properties:

1. `PlayerName`, which should return the _string_ with the AI's name.
2. `Thinker`, which should return an instance of the class that implements
   [`IThinker`].

The instance of the class that implements [`IThinker`] should be created in
`Awake()`. However, the `Awake()` in the base class [`AIPlayer`], which is a
`protected virtual` method, must also be called. Take a look at the [example
AIs][`Assets/Scripts/AI/AIs/`] to check how this should be implemented.

For AIs that really want to search as long as possible, the time limit is
available in the `AITimeLimit` property, and can be passed to the thinker
during its instantiation in `Awake()`.

### The class that implements `IThinker`

This class is where the AI should be implemented. The [`IThinker`] interface
defines the `Think()` method, which accepts the [game board][`Board`] and a
[cancellation token][`CancellationToken`], returning a [`FutureMove`]. Simply
put, the method accepts the game board, the AI decides the best move to
perform, and returns that move, which will eventually be executed by the game
engine.

#### Cancellation requests

The main thread may ask the AI to stop *thinking*, for example if the thinking
time limit has expired. Thus, while *thinking*, the AI should frequently test
if a cancellation request was made to the
[cancellation token][`CancellationToken`]. If so, it should return immediately
with no move performed, as exemplified in the following code:

```cs
if (ct.IsCancellationRequested) return FutureMove.NoMove;
```

#### Thinker code limitations

The `Think()` method is called in a separate thread from the main Unity thread.
As such, most Unity classes and objects cannot be used by the thinker,
especially those used in Unity's game loop, e.g. [`Time`] and [`Random`][urnd].
The [`Mathf`] functions can be used without problems, since they do not depend
on anything other than the input they are given.

Timing and random number generation functionality, useful or even mandatory for
the thinker, can be obtained with native C# types such as [`DateTime`], [`TimeSpan`] and [`Random`].

#### Game board functionality inside the thinker

The thinker can freely modify the [game board][`Board`], since this is a copy
and not the original game board being used in the main Unity thread. More
specifically, the thinker can try moves with the `DoMove()` method, and cancel
them with the `UndoMove()` method. The board keeps track of the move history,
so the thinker can perform any sequence of moves, and roll them back
afterwards.

The `CheckWinner()` method is useful to determine if there is a winner. If
there is one, the solution is placed in the method's `out` parameter.

For building heuristics, the public read-only variable `winCorridors` is your
friend. This variable is a collection containing all corridors (sequences of
positions) where good or winning piece sequences may exist.

### Project submission

The project should be submitted by groups of 2 or 3 students, via Moodle,
before January 7, 23:00.
